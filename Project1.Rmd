# **Project 1: Skyscrapers**

## *Question 1:*

The following dataset was created by Austin Cory Bart on in 2016 based on information provided by the [Skyscraper Center](https://www.ctbuh.org/?redirect=true) . It includes variables related to the height, material, start/end year of construction (as well as total years to build), city, and name of the building. 

This study will include how the total height of the buildings were influenced by the material they were built with, the total number of years it took to build them, and the number of floors they include.

## *Question 2:*

The distribution of building height can be seen in the graph below:

``` {r echo=FALSE, out.width = '750px', dpi=200}
ggP1Sky=ggplot(P1Sky)

ggP1Sky + geom_histogram(aes(x=Height), binwidth=15, col='black', fill='darkgreen') + labs(title="Distribution of Skyscraper Height", x="Height (meters)", y="Frequency") + theme_classic()
```

The tallest building in the data set is the `r P1Sky$Name[P1Sky$Height==max(P1Sky$Height)]`, with a total height of `r P1Sky$Height[P1Sky$Height==max(P1Sky$Height)]` meters. The shortest building in the data set is the `r P1Sky$Name[P1Sky$Height==min(P1Sky$Height)]`, with a height of `r P1Sky$Height[P1Sky$Height==min(P1Sky$Height)]` meters. The median building of the data set is the `r P1Sky$Name[P1Sky$Height==median(P1Sky$Height)]` building, with a height of `r P1Sky$Height[P1Sky$Height==median(P1Sky$Height)]`. This relationship is indicative of the 5 number summary shown below:

```{r echo=FALSE}
round(fivenum(P1Sky$Height), digits=2)
```
Based on the information above, we can conclude that the distribution of heights is right skewed, and the majority of buildings are at or around `r round(mean(P1Sky$Height), digits=2)` meters.

## *Question 3:*

In this section, I will compare the bivariate relationship between building height and the following values

### *Building Material:*

The distribution of building height by material is shown in the graph below:

``` {r echo=FALSE, out.width = '750px', dpi=200}
ggP1Sky + geom_boxplot(aes(x=Material,y=Height, col=Material))+labs(title="Building Height by Material", x="Building Material", y="Height (Meters)") + scale_color_brewer(type="qual", palette=2)
```

The table below shows the mean aggregate between the height and material variables:

``` {r echo=FALSE, out.width = '750px', dpi=200}
aggregate(Height~Material, data=P1Sky, mean )
```
Based on this illustration of the data, we can see that buildings made with masonry materials are, on average, shorter than other buildings; on the other hand, buildings made with composite materials are, on average, taller than other buildings. 

### *Years to Build:*

The distribution of building height by years to build is shown in the graph below:

``` {r echo=FALSE, out.width = '750px', dpi=200}
ggP1Sky + geom_point(aes(x=YearsToBuild,y=Height), alpha=.6, pch=19, col='orange', )+labs(title="Building Height by Years to Build", x="Years To Build", y="Height (Meters)")
```

The height of the building that took the longest to build was `r P1Sky$Height[P1Sky$YearsToBuild==max(P1Sky$YearsToBuild)]` meters tall while the tallest building took `r P1Sky$YearsToBuild[P1Sky$Height==max(P1Sky$Height)]` years to build. The correlation between the height and number of years it takes to build a specific building is `r round(cor(P1Sky$Height, P1Sky$YearsToBuild), digits=3)`, meaning they are only slightly positively correlated. This is also representative of the above graph, as there is only a slight positive trend between height and years to build. 

### *Floors*

The distribution of building height by floors is shown in the graph below:

``` {r echo=FALSE, out.width = '750px', dpi=200}
ggP1Sky + geom_point(aes(x=Floors,y=Height), alpha=.6, pch=19, col='royalblue3', )+labs(title="Distribution of Building Height by Floors", x="Floors", y="Height (Meters)")
```

As we can see from the graph, as the height of a building increases, the number of floors also increases. The correlation of the two variables is `r round(cor(P1Sky$Height, P1Sky$Floors), digits=3)`, meaning it is very positively correlated, which supports the claim above. The tallest building (the `r P1Sky$Name[P1Sky$Height==max(P1Sky$Height)]`) has `r P1Sky$Floors[P1Sky$Height==max(P1Sky$Height)]` floors while the shortest building (the `r P1Sky$Name[P1Sky$Height==min(P1Sky$Height)]`) has `r P1Sky$Floors[P1Sky$Height==min(P1Sky$Height)]` floors. 

## *Question 4:*

### *Conclusion*

From the data we've collected, we can see that the height of a building is highly indicative of the number of floors it has, but not very related to the number of years it took to build. The building material used can tell us about how likely a building is to be taller or shorter, where masonry buildings are typically shorter and composite buildings are typically taller. On average, the buildings in this study were 130 meters tall, but varied from ~40-500 meters. In the future, organizing the heights of buildings by their specific cities could reveal trends related to the climate, construction process, or even people in that specific area.
